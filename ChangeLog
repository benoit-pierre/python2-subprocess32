2012-02-18 3.2.3b1
------------------

This release brings in the last year and a half's worth of bugfixes and
improvements to Python 3.2's subprocess module:

Off the top of my head, some major bugfix highlights include:
 * Timeout support on the APIs.
 * close_fds=True is now the default (as it is in 3.2) and performs much faster.
 * Fixed EINTR handling.
 * Fixed SIGCHLD handling.
 * Fixed several race conditions.
 * Many more bug fixes too numerous to list.
